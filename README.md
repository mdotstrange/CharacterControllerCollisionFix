# CharacterControllerCollisionFix

This is my attempt to fix the issue with Unity's Character Controller object wherein it pops into the air 
whenever it comes in contact with a rigid body.

My solution is very rough as I'm a novice coder and am lost in the world of Vector math 0_0.
If you can improve upon it, please do and let me know ^_^ Thanks.
